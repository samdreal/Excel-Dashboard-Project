Age Group Analysis: Gain a deeper understanding of bike purchasing patterns by different age groups. The dashboard allows users to visualize the count of bikes purchased across different age brackets, facilitating targeted marketing strategies and product development.

Distance Analysis: Track the count of bike purchases based on distance, enabling businesses to identify preferences for short-distance commuting or long-distance cycling adventures.

Interactive Slicers: Three interactive slicers enhance the dashboard's functionality:

Marital Status: Users can filter data based on marital status, distinguishing between married and single customers.
Region: Explore bike sales trends across different regions, including Europe, North America, and the Pacific.
Education: Analyze bike purchases based on customers' educational backgrounds, ranging from high school to graduate degrees.
With its user-friendly interface and interactive features, the Bike Sales Dashboard empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize marketing efforts, and tailor product offerings to specific demographic segments.
